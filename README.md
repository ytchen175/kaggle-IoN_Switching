# Description

Ion channels are pore-forming proteins present in animals and plants. \
They encode learning and memory, help fight infections, enable pain signals, and stimulate muscle contraction. 

This dataset contains continuous time series of up to 5 million rows, with only three columns: time, signal, and the target: open_channels. 

# Result
I generated a large number of rolling statistics and normalization for increasing the number of features greatly. \
Finally, I got 92.7% accuracy in test set.
